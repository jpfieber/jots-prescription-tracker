Notes are automatically organized using the configured date format:
- Default: `Prescriptions/2025/2025-08/20250803 - Rx6298009 -- Progesterone 100MG.md`
- With daily folders: `Prescriptions/2025/08/03/20250803 - Rx6298009 -- Progesterone 100MG.md`

### YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
fileClass: Prescriptions
filename: 20250803 - Rx6298009 -- Progesterone 100MG.md
created: 2025-08-03T10:30:00.000Z
rxNum: "6298009"
medication: Progesterone
diagnosis: 
pharmacy: CVS Pharmacy
prescriber: Dr. Smith
qtyWrit: 
qtyDisp: 30 capsules
refills: 5
dose: 100MG
dateWritten:

mfg: Pfizer
patient: John Doe
drugLabel: +Inbox/prescription-label-scan.pdf
substituted: 
daySupply: 30
dateFinished: 2025-08-31
---
```

**Notes**: 
- `dateFinished` is automatically calculated by adding the `daySupply` to the `dateObtained` date.
- `drugLabel` can be selected from files in the `+Inbox` folder via dropdown.
- `prescriber` will contain a link to the doctor's note when selected from the dropdown (e.g., `[[Dr. John Smith]]`).

### People Notes Format
For the prescriber dropdown to work, your people notes should have YAML frontmatter like:
```yaml
---
name: Dr. John Smith
relationship: doctor
# ... other properties
---
```

The plugin will scan your people folder for notes where the relationship property matches your configured doctor value.
